# Statistical Analysis of Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on States of India
Novel coronavirus, i.e., COVID-19 affected the human lifestyle in a great extent worldwide. Economy, health, and employment are among the severely affected sectors of India, which suffered in many aspects. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to calculate and analyze the impact of COVID-19 in several states of India through which the recovery process can be planned and initialized. The proposed method analyzes the overall impact of coronavirus by considering several significant attributes from different sectors, viz, death rate, COVID-positive cases, testing, GDP-rate, inflation-rate, etc. The experiments conducted on the real and authentic dataset obtained from Indian govt. websites. Each state is assigned a grade based on the score calculated using statistical analysis which represents the impact of COVID-19. The proposed method presents a hypothesis which can be really useful for planning and implementing the rehabilitation, and recovery from the effect of COVID-19 in India.
